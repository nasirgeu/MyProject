            <hr />
            <p class="para">
                <br /> The online course registration system is the central part of the educational administration system, which consists of registration guidance, registration controlling, undergraduate course registration, graduate course registration,
                retaking and retesting, dropping the course in the middle phase and information exchange, etc. The new course registration system at Tsinghua University was put into use in April 2009. By registering the course voluntarily, the new system
                improved registration mechanism, implemented course registration of common course for undergraduate and graduate students, and also supported the teaching activities across spring, summer and fall semesters. This article introduces the
                design and implementation of the new online course registration system, including registration mechanism, technical architecture, and system design, etc
